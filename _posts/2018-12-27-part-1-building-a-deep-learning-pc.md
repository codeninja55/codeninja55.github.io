title: [Part 1 of 3] Building a Deep Learning PC
status: draft
---

So while I have only recently slowly got into data science and using deep learning libraries. I have been preparing for 
this future ever since I started my computer science degree two years ago. And now it has come the time I really 
(yes, really) needed to get myself some better hardware to move to the next level of my education.

Machine learning and deep learning optimized computers are an expensive endeavour. Trust me, I have looked (if you are 
curious, this [prebuilt device](https://www.nvidia.com/en-au/data-center/dgx-2/) by nVidia is pretty slick). While my 
system is worth more than what most people would spend on a PC, I reasoned that I would using this to built some fairly
large ML models before long and would use it going forward into my academic research career. So I was more than willing
to add some serious juice.
